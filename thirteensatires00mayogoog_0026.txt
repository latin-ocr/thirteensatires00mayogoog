Nireus is the only tme nobility: ii you are just in word ond deod, by
these features I recoynise you (aynosco 26) es a noble: otherwise your
illustrious name may but be applied in mockery. as we cell a dwart
an Atlas (1-38). Rubellius may boast ol his enoestor Iulus: but it
he sits still as a stook, while plebeiam ure aetively serving their
country in the law-court or the camp, he must look to be condemned
like the lagging horse in the circus, whorn no pedigree can save [rom
the mill or the cart (so-70). Would you know how to live as befits
your descent? Bes breve soldier, a just judge‚ an honest governor,
aa wellin unwarlike Corinth as in rude Geul or Spain. So will high
birth be indeed an honour to you; whereas it only brings out in
more glaring colours the crimes ol the oppressor or debauehee (71-
145). So is it with Lateranus, who, thoughaeonsular, lives the lile ι
of a vulgar sot: a slave, who should do the same, would bs sent to ¹
worlr in chains in the country (rto-182). Other nobles, still more Ι,
completely lost to shame‚ appear on the stage. 130 it so, that they
are well paid: what oi thatr No plea, but that ot necessity, ean
palliate the offence. Nor indeed can that: better were itte die,
than to act with Thymele or Corinthus uss-197). Beyond this
tbere is hutone lower stage ol inlamy,-the arena: ¹end even there
you moy see a Gracchus, and see him too, as though determined to
publish abroad his shame, choose those arms which least ol all hide
the wearer‘s features. No wonder that the very gladiatore are
ashemed ol so degenerate an antagonist ‹res-uluy. llone can *oa
ol nobler birth than Nero, yet he exoeeded the crime ot Orestes„
