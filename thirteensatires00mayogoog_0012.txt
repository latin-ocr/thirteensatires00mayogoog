Bailey (H. R. B.)‚ the Public Orator (J. Ε. 8.), and my
brother (J. B. M.) ⁹. Ι have, as will be seen, examined

the manuscript notes of Stanley‚ Hadr. Beverland‚ John
Taylor³, Markland⁴, Bottiger and John Mitford⁶. From

scripta, sie madida lere charta (ut nemini hie meorum non comper-
tissimum est) ad typographos deserebantur.
