master Hirrus ;-sooner will 1 rehearse the mansione now owned by him,
under whose razor my strong beard rustled in my youth. 0110 iefeeble

1010111101 wauton 00111000, learnt by many yeare’ apprenticeship in the
dungcou 01 the atowe. Grant him still sound in mind, yet he must lead
out his sons to burial, must gaze on 1110 beloved wife’s and his brother's
pyra, on urus charged with sistere' duat. This forfeit is laid on all long
livers; stroke on stroke lighting upon their home, they grew old amid
‘griels always green, a household still in tears‚', in 0 standing livary cf ·

and hear him repining at fate’s decrees, 01 the thread 01 days 100 larishly

funeral flama, he aske every comrade about 111111, why he laste to theee
years, what he ever did 10 (1000110 00 lingering an age? So Peleus mur·
mured, while he mourned Achilles untimely snatched away, so Laertes,
whom nature bide lameut the 0101111-1001 Ulixes. While Troy was yet
secure, Priam would 11010 made his laet progrees to the shade 01 Assaracus

before Paris began 1ο build his daring keels. What theu did Priam win
by the long respite? He saw 0 general wreck, all Asia crumbling under
fire and swerd Thau doffing his diadem, he took arms, a tottering
soldier [⁸ a soldier half, andhalf 0 sacrifice ’] and dropped down before the
altar of high Iuppiter, like some decrepit 01001, which disdaiued long
since by the thankless plough, tamely yields 10 his maeter's 1111110 0
neck lean and pitiable. Yet that was at least 0 human death; his queen
outlived him, but only to glare grimly and 011011 with a true cur'e grin
[‘ 0011110110 bitch and barked away her life’]. Ihasten now 1ο Rome,
passing Mithradates b , and Croesus, whom righteoue Solon's eloquent
10100 charged to regard the closing eveniug of a long life. Banishment,
jail, Minturnae’s 10110, the bread 01 beggary 111 vanquished Carthage,-all
these lapse 01 days brought upon Marius. What would nature ever 11010
