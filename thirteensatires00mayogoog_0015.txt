, In my notes I have endeavoured at‘once to meet the
[wants of English studente (in general little accustomed
to consult original authorities and debarred from the
best and latest books of reference) and also to supply
new materiale for the grammarian, lexicographer and
, historian¹. Following the steps of Oasaubon and Gataker,
Scaliger and Hemsterhuis, Ι have drawn materiale from ,
writers, accessible to me, of every racc and creed. ·I see
only a riddle in the taste, which, allowing Libanius‚ lays
Chrysostom under ban; scouring the world for an inscrip
tion, while blind to a vast literature ready to hand. Were
Philo a pagan, his historica] tracto would assuredly rank
as pri'celess evidence respecting the early empire. Even
lexicography. has suffered by the stigma cast on men, who
had served many philosophies before they bowed 'their
necks beneath the cross; for it might then be said, fiunt,
aon nascautur Christiani.

I have purposely abstained from consulting any English
edition of J uvenal. ’

Sr Jonrv’s, Sept. 9, 1878.

² Iknow not why Mr A Palmer (Hermathena r 391) should suppose
that Ov. m. vm 283 had ‘oscapod my notice '. It is printed at length, in
both editions, in the note on 1v 27, and this note is cited on v 147, the
verse which Mr Palmer is discussing; see too Dobroe advers. 11 387.
The other quotation should be not ‘met x. 38. ν, 1’ but v 381, which,
with this correction,1 gratefully accept, Ii Mr Palmer will consult tho
ind. under sed, he will sce other authorities, Hc does not observa that ·
Ribbeck corrupta both lines by the sume oheap nostrum, nec for sed (1v 27
neo maioris se). Bergk’s wurning (speaking of the Teubner Gellius Jahrbb.
cxrrr 1876 276) is certainly opportune: ‘wenn dies eo fort geht, so vird,
ehenochmals dreissig jahro verflossen sind, jeder mann von hildung und
geschmack sich mit widerwillcn von den in Deutschland erechienen neuen
ausgabcn lateinischer schriitsteller abwenden’
