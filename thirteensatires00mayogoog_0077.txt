nation of the most difficnlt point, quanti sua fenera ete: funera, as he
takes it, even 11 Latin which I doubt, could not have been intelligible
with the context to a Latin reader3 and in my opinion his interpreta-
tion weakens, 11 11 does not destroy, the point of the contrast between
thess words, and Finge tanen gladios cet. with which they were evi·
dently intended to contrast. Juvenal here, 11 in other places, referring
to an ege long past, that of Nero, in his rhetorical way, as 11 11 were
present, and indeed mentally thinking of it as present, 11 necessarily
obscure. In describing too this Rea memoranda novis annalibus a
recenti Historia Ibelieve hs had Tacitus annal. x1w14etc. before hrm,
and perhaps some other oi the authorities of Dio quoted by you: 188
189 foll. seems almost to refer to Tacitus: moe altro occari populere
Romanae laudibusque extollerent eat balans cupiens voluptatum...nolr'·
liant familiarum posteros egestate 1111111 in scenam dedra-it cet. I
cannot understand why Madvig should deny that funera vendere ior
vitam vendere is Latin, the two ideas being interchangeable aud the
Latius often thus using mora. redimere aliquid vita und tha like are
common in Cicero: see Nizolius aud Freund: but then Caesar bel. Gall.

posset: OvidexPonto 1111 105 Sintes mors redimenda tua...eeset.· 11
11 venderes tuam mortem ut meam redimeres. Well then Juvenal says
‘At what price these creaturos eell their deaths, what matter τ’ (1 omit
for the moment 193 cendant-ludia). Sane tanen gladios cet. ‘yet ifthe
choice were given them “will you go on the stege or be killedt'’ I should
have thought that none would have hesitated for 1 moment to choose
death, rather then be zelotypae etc.:' thus you get a direct eontrast
between quanti aff. 1., end Serere 111111 gladios etc. whioh is
intended. «quena in his indignation does not ehooee to distin '
between their actual degradation and what he thinks they ought to real:
